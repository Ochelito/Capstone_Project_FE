# APPlai - Web App Job Application Tracker

**CAPSTONE PROJECT - FRONTEND**

APPlai is a modern, responsive web application designed to help job seekers efficiently **manage and track their job search activities**. It provides a centralized digital workspace where users can record, monitor, and analyze every stage of their job huntâ€”from initial application to interview follow-ups and final offers. The app is built with scalability in mind, with future extensions for mobile and desktop versions.

## Problem It Solves

Job searching can be chaotic and overwhelming. Many job seekers struggle to keep track of:

- Which jobs they applied for  
- Application dates  
- Documents sent  
- Interview schedules  
- Feedback received  
- Application deadlines and statuses  

Most people rely on spreadsheets or notes apps, neither of which are tailored for this task. APPlai brings structure, reminders, and clarity to the job search process.
